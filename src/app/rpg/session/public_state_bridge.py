"""Bridge legacy/public player projections into the authoritative simulation.

Older and presentation-first sessions may keep the player wallet and inventory
under ``session.state.player`` while mechanics read ``simulation_state``.  The
bridge copies only missing bootstrap fields into the simulation and projects
authoritative mechanic-owned fields back to the public state after a mutation.
