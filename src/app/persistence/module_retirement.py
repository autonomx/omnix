"""Driving a retiring module's durable work to a final state (ADR-0016, PA-4.3).

``scripts/retire_module.py`` drains a module, then calls ``cancel_remaining``
and checks ``in_flight_work`` before it marks the module retired. Everything
here goes through the kernel repositories and records reason
``module_retired``; nothing deletes rows. The work spans every workspace, so it
runs as the ``operator.cli`` system operation.
