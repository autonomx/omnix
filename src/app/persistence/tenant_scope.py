"""Row-level security scope of PostgreSQL sessions (WP-4.4).

Migration 0106 isolates every tenant table with a policy that reads two
session settings:

- ``omnix.workspace_id``: the workspace of the current tenant;
- ``omnix.system``: ``on`` only inside a named system operation that must see
  every workspace (claiming jobs, recovery scans, retention, sign-in lookups).

``apply_session_scope`` sets both when a connection is checked out of the
pool, so a unit of work runs entirely as the tenant that opened it. A query
that forgets its ``workspace_id`` filter still sees only that workspace.
