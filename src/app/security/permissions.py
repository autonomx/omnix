"""Role-based authorization with a permission catalog (WP-4.3).

Permissions are ``<domain>:<action>`` strings. Every route is checked:

* a route may declare its permission with ``openapi_extra=requires("x:y")``,
  which replaces the default and appears in the OpenAPI document;
* otherwise the default comes from the owning feature (or the kernel path
  table): its read permission for GET/HEAD, its write permission for any
  other method and for WebSockets.

Roles come from the request's TenantContext (WP-4.2). With sign-in off the
local tenant holds ``owner``, so local installs keep full access.
