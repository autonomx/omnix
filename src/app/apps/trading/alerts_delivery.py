"""Alert notification delivery: the outbox, the webhook sender and the delivery monitor (TVP-0.5a).

A trigger that selects a delivery channel gets one outbox row per channel, in
the transaction that records the trigger (``enqueue_alert_deliveries``). The
delivery monitor claims due rows one at a time with a lease, sends outside any
transaction through a ``NotificationSender`` and records the result: delivered,
another attempt after an exponential backoff, or failed. Triggers stay
authoritative and delivery is at-least-once: a pass that dies between sending
and recording sends again when its lease expires, with the same delivery id
(``X-Omnix-Delivery``), so receivers can drop the duplicate. A lease that
expires after the last attempt fails the delivery instead.

One monitor serves every workspace: it claims and records in the
``notifications.delivery`` system scope. The API lists a workspace's own rows.

Webhook rules:

- HTTPS only; the URL and signing secret come from the protected store by the
  alert's current reference (never stored in PostgreSQL). If the alert's
  reference changed between claim and send, the delivery is retried, not failed;
- the hostname (IDNA form) is resolved once, within a bounded time, and every
  address checked with the strict outbound URL policy (nothing that is not
  globally routable unless ``OMNIX_ALLOWED_PRIVATE_NETWORKS`` names it); the
  request goes to a checked address, in the system's preference order with
  fallback to the next one, with the hostname for TLS (SNI and certificate
  verification) and ``Host``, so DNS cannot rebind it;
- one deadline bounds the whole send (resolution, connection, response
  headers): a watchdog shuts the socket down (never closes it from another
  thread); the response body is never read; no redirects, no proxies; nothing
  logs the URL (the HTTP client's request log is not used);
- throughput: at most ``MAX_SENDS_PER_PASS`` sends per pass of the monitor
  (every 10 s), about 24 a minute: enough for one trader's alerts, not for
  fan-out to many receivers;
- the body is the trigger's message, ``application/json`` when it parses as
  JSON, else ``text/plain``;
- with a secret, ``X-Omnix-Signature: sha256=<hex>`` is the HMAC-SHA256 of
  ``<X-Omnix-Timestamp>.<X-Omnix-Delivery>.<body>``.

``last_error`` holds a reason code, never a URL, secret or response body.
