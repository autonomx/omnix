"""PHASE 5.1 — Replay vs Live Validator

Ensures replay reconstructs exact same state as live execution.

This validator addresses the core requirement from rpg-design.txt:
- Replay = Live execution

The validation strategy:
1. Run a live game loop with events
2. Run a fresh loop and replay the same events via ReplayEngine
3. Compare state hashes

If hashes match, replay parity is proven.
If hashes differ, replay is missing or corrupting state.

KNOWN SOURCES OF REPLAY MISMATCH:
- ReplayEngine calling load_history() (deprecated, causes duplication)
- Replay not advancing loop._tick_count (causes tick collision)
- Replay not dispatching to system handle_event() (state not reconstructed)
- Events sorted differently in replay vs live
- Non-deterministic timestamps between runs
