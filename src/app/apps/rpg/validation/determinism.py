"""PHASE 5.1 — Determinism Validator

Ensures identical runs produce identical results.

This validator addresses the core requirement from rpg-design.txt:
- Determinism: same input -> same output

The validation strategy:
1. Create two identical game loops from the same factory
2. Feed both loops the same events
3. Run both loops for the same number of ticks
4. Compare state hashes

If hashes match, determinism is proven for the given inputs.
If hashes differ, the system has non-deterministic behavior.

KNOWN SOURCES OF NON-DETERMINISM:
- LLM randomness (temperature > 0, random seeds)
- Timestamps (wall clock time)
- unordered dicts / sets in state
- UUID randomness in event IDs
- Random number generators without fixed seeds

FIXES (from rpg-design.txt):
- temperature = 0, seed = fixed
- inject deterministic clock
- always sort dicts/sets
- deterministic ID generator in test mode
