"""Deterministic RPG spatial scene graph helpers.

The spatial package is simulation-authoritative.  It answers questions such as:

- where is an entity?
- can an entity move between areas?
- can an entity see another entity?
- can an entity hear another entity?

LLM narration may describe these results, but must not invent them.
