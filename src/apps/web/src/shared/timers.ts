 * Timers for the web app (WP-9.6). Two kinds, kept apart:
 *
 * - `startPolling`: reading server state that has no server event. Runs on a
 *   setTimeout chain, so a slow request never overlaps the next one, and
 *   skips its turn while the page is hidden. Each caller uses an interval
 *   from `POLL_INTERVALS_MS`, which says why that resource is polled.
 * - `startTicker` / `useNow`: fixed-rate local cadence with no server
 *   involved: clocks and elapsed counters, replay playback, avatar mouth
 *   frames, capture sampling and local schedulers.
 *
 * Server state with events (job lifecycle on `/events`) is not polled; see
 * `events/useJobEventRefresh.ts`.
