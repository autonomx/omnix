"""GitHub Actions wrapper for rate-limit-resilient historical strategy sweeps.

The production provider runtime keeps short retries suitable for interactive use.
Historical Actions sweeps are different: one Alpaca IEX batch can span many chunks,
and restarting the whole reconstruction after a late HTTP 429 wastes the requests
that already succeeded. This wrapper gives each individual historical request a
longer bounded backoff so the batch resumes at the failed chunk.
